# Detecting_the_Higgs
The aim of this investigation has been to calculate the optimal selection cuts to maximize the probability of detecting the Higgs
boson. The Higgs boson has been predicted theoretically to have a Gaussian mass distribution around 125.1 GeV/c2. This value
can be inferred by calculating the invariant mass of a photon pair which is produced when the Higgs boson decays. However,
there are more decays which result in a photon pair in the colliders where we try to replicate this process, which makes it
hard to detect the ones coming from a Higgs decay. The aforementioned selection cuts are the limits of the integration
which is performed to the total number of detections in order to find the average number of selected photon pairs from the
Higgs. Using a numerical maximization method to maximize the significance of the Higgs signal, the value of these selection cuts
was found to be 123.237514 and 127.158489 GeV/c2. A number of sources of error were considered to calculate the probability
of measuring a 5-sigma signal. This probability was found to be between 43.66% and 66.73%.

Run both files. The relevant numerical values will be printed. The numerical integration methods file displays the 
accuracies of different numerical integration methods. It takes a couple of minutes to run. The 'detecting the higgs'
file shows the figures used and prints the rest of the numerical values used in the investigation. The discussion on
the accuracy of using improper integrals is carried out in this file too.
